# Netflix Landing Page Clone

This project is a clone of [Netflix's](https://www.netflix.com/) landing page, developed with modern web technologies to ensure high performance and maintainability. The key technologies used in this project are:

- **SCSS** for styling, enabling modular and reusable styles.
- **TypeScript** for scripting, providing type safety and enhancing code quality.
- **React** for the front-end framework, ensuring a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Vite** as the build tool, offering fast and efficient development and build processes.

The page is fully responsive, mirroring the adaptability of the original Netflix landing page across various devices and screen sizes.

Additionally, the page supports two languages, English and Russian, utilizing `react-i18next` for internationalization and localization.
